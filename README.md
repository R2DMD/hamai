The HamAI framework provides capabilities for AI robots to use radio bands for voice communication.

Attention! 
Transmitting on radio frequencies without an appropriate license is prohibited. Since most countries do not issue radio licenses to AI radio operators, limit your AI radio bots to license-free bands (e.g., CB, PMR, LPD, FRS). Check your country's regulations regarding the use of radio spectrum for AI agents.
