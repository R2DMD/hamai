The HamAI framework provides capabilities for AI robots to use radio spectrum for voice communication.

> [!CAUTION]
> Transmitting on radio frequencies without an appropriate license is prohibited. Since most countries do not issue radio licenses to AI radio operators, limit your AI radio bots to license-free bands (e.g., CB, PMR, LPD, FRS). Check your country's regulations regarding the use of radio spectrum for AI agents.
